![](https://media.giphy.com/media/Ae6zESb3i5g9W/giphy.gif)]]

.pull-right[
### The research question posed to this end is whether volatility in China has a significant impact on volatility in other markets and whether this impact has been increasing over time.

There is a nascent body of literature documenting the fact that shocks to the onceisolated Chinese stock market are having greater implications for financial markets all over the world.]

## VAR and Structural VAR

.center[![](var.png)]


.left[
- The variables used in this VAR are volatility indices for seven different financial markets. A seven-variate VAR is estimated for each period and the lag length is chosen according to the Hannan-Quinn information Criteria.
- In the periods before and after the stock market crash the optimal lag length is 2 and during the crash period, the optimal lag is 1.

#### The Cholesky ordering is based on the open time for the relevant stock markets. Since the influence of the Chinese financial market is being investigated, the Chinese volatility index will be put first.

## Variance Decompositions

## Variance Decompositions 
### Immediate Effect - After 1 Day

.pull-left[
- For Japan, about 18% variation due to the variation in China’s stock market in during-period, and only 3% in pre-period. 
- For India, France, and The US, there are large increases in their variation that is due to the variation in the Chinese stock market in During-crash period comparing to the pre-crash period.

## Variance Decompositions 
### Short Term Effect - After 1 Week 
.pull-left[ 
- In general there is a large spike in the percentage variance in forecasted volatility in each stock market that is due to the variance in china’s stock market in the during period. 
- In period after crash, these percentages fall to a level but they still higher than that in the pre-crash period.

## Diebold-Yilmaz Spillover Index 
```{r}
tribble(
  ~ " ", ~"H=1(one day after shock) ", ~"H=5(one week after shock) ", ~"H=25(one month after shock) ",
  "pre-crisis", 0.16691, 0.27544, 0.40123,   
  "during-crisis", 0.40064, 0.58175, 0.67241,
  "post-crisis", 0.19097, 0.43093, 0.56084) %>%
  knitr::kable(format = "html")
```

.left[
- Firstly, it seems that over longer forecast horizons volatility spillover between financial markets increases.   
- Secondly, there is a higher degree of volatility spillover between the markets considered during the period covered by China’s stock market crash.   
- While the degree of volatility spillover between markets falls in post-crash period relative to the period covered by the crash, it increases relative to the period prior to the crash. ]
